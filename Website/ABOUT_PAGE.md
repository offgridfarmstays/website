## Section 1: Our Story

### Headline
**From One Experiment to 50+ Success Stories**

### The Origin Story

It started with a simple question: **What if we could make land pay for itself?**

In 2021, our founder—a renewable energy engineer with 15 years in solar installation—inherited 30 acres of Montana ranchland. Beautiful property, but it was bleeding money in property taxes while sitting vacant. Traditional options didn't pencil out:

- ❌ Selling? That meant giving up family land.
- ❌ Conventional farming? Low margins, high labor.
- ❌ Standard rental cabin? Expensive build, slow payback.

Then came the insight: **What if excess solar production could become bitcoin revenue?**

We designed a 450 sq ft luxury mini-home with a 15 kW solar array. The retreat used 30% of the power. The other 70% powered bitcoin mining equipment that generated passive income 24/7. We captured the mining heat to provide free hot water for guests.

**The results shocked us**:
- Construction cost: $72,000
- Guest bookings: $2,400/month (AirBTC platform)
- Bitcoin earnings: $1,100/month
- **Total: $3,500/month = $42,000/year**
- **Payback: 1.7 years**

Friends with land started asking: *"Can you build one for me?"*

We built three more properties in 2022. Then ten in 2023. By 2024, we had a waiting list of landowners across the Mountain West wanting the same transformation.

**Today**, Offgrid Farmstays is a team of engineers, contractors, and bitcoin enthusiasts who've proven a new model: **land + clean energy + bitcoin = generational wealth building**.

We've completed 50+ projects across 12 states. Our clients have collectively generated over 15 million kWh of clean solar energy and earned more than 45 bitcoin while hosting thousands of guests in unforgettable off-grid experiences.

## Section 2: Our Mission & Values

### Headline
**What We Stand For**

### 3-Column Value Pillars

**Column 1: Energy Sovereignty**
⚡

**We believe in energy independence.**

Landowners shouldn't be hostage to utility companies or fossil fuel price swings. Solar + battery + bitcoin mining creates true energy autonomy—you produce your power, monetize the excess, and answer to no one.

Every retreat we build is a small node of decentralized energy production. This is the future grid: distributed, renewable, and unstoppable.

---

**Column 2: Bitcoin Adoption Through Utility**
₿

**We believe bitcoin succeeds through real-world use, not speculation.**

Bitcoin isn't just an investment—it's a tool for freedom, savings, and parallel economies. By integrating bitcoin mining with productive real estate, we show landowners bitcoin's true power: turning excess resources into hard money.

We're bitcoin educators as much as builders. Every project orange-pills another landowner.

---

**Column 3: Regenerative Wealth**
🌱

**We believe land should generate wealth for generations, not extract value.**

Conventional development often degrades land for short-term profit. We build light-footprint structures powered by clean energy that enhance property value while preserving natural beauty.

Our retreats don't harm the land—they make it more valuable, more productive, and more enjoyable for owners, guests, and future generations.
