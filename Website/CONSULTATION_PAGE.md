## Section 5: Common Questions

### FAQs About the Consultation

**Q: Is this really free?**
A: Yes. Zero cost for assessment and feasibility report. We only charge when you sign a contract for actual design and construction.

**Q: Will I be pressured to commit?**
A: No. We give you information and a recommendation. You decide if and when to proceed. We don't do high-pressure sales‚Äîit's not our style.

**Q: What if my property isn't a good fit?**
A: We'll tell you honestly. We've walked away from projects with poor solar exposure, impossible zoning, or economics that don't work. You'll still get a feasibility report explaining why and possible alternatives.

**Q: How soon can you visit my property?**
A: Typically within 1-3 weeks of initial call, depending on travel logistics and your schedule. If you're urgent, we can often accommodate faster.

**Q: Can we do the consultation entirely remotely (no site visit)?**
A: Sometimes, if you can provide detailed photos, videos, and property information. But we prefer site visits for accuracy‚Äîterrain, solar angles, and access conditions are hard to assess from photos alone.

**Q: What should I prepare before the consultation?**
A: Helpful (but not required):
- Recent photos of the land (multiple angles, views)
- Property survey or plat (if you have it)
- Any existing structures or utilities documentation
- Your goals and vision clearly articulated
- Budget constraints (honest conversation helps us help you)

**Q: Do you assess properties outside your current service states?**
A: Possibly. Contact us‚Äîwe're expanding and evaluate new markets based on demand. Worst case, we can recommend partners or provide remote guidance.

**Q: What happens if I'm not ready for 6-12 months?**
A: No problem. We provide the feasibility report. You keep it, use it to plan, and contact us when timing is right. We're here when you're ready.

## Section 6: Who This Is For

### You're in the Right Place If:

‚úÖ You own land (5+ acres) that's currently underutilized
‚úÖ You're curious about passive income generation
‚úÖ You're open to learning about bitcoin (we teach)
‚úÖ You value expert guidance over DIY trial-and-error
‚úÖ You're thinking 3-5+ years (generational wealth building)
‚úÖ Your property has reasonable solar exposure (most do!)
‚úÖ You can invest $40K-$150K (or explore financing options)

---

### This Might Not Be for You If:

‚ùå You're purely speculating (not serious about building)
‚ùå You need immediate income (6-8 month timeline minimum)
‚ùå You want to DIY the entire project
‚ùå Your property has severe constraints (we'll assess honestly)
‚ùå You're not willing to host guests (or hire a manager)
‚ùå You expect guaranteed bitcoin returns (we're realistic, not pie-in-sky)

**Not sure?** Submit the form anyway. Worst case, we tell you it's not a fit and provide free guidance. Best case, we uncover potential you didn't see.

## Section 7: Testimonials (What Others Say About Our Consultation)

### Client Feedback

**"The consultation was incredibly thorough. They didn't sugarcoat challenges‚Äîmy zoning was complex‚Äîbut they showed me a pathway I hadn't considered. Now I'm 3 months into construction on a retreat that should pay itself off in 2.5 years."**
‚Äî Tom R., Vermont

---

**"I was skeptical about bitcoin mining. During the consultation, they explained it so clearly‚Äînot as speculation but as energy monetization. The numbers made sense even in conservative scenarios. I signed the contract the next week."**
‚Äî Sarah M., Montana

---

**"They actually turned down my first property idea because the solar exposure was poor (too many trees, wrong slope). Instead, they suggested a different corner of my land I hadn't considered. That honesty earned my trust immediately."**
‚Äî Linda K., Oregon
