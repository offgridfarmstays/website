**From Consultation to First Guest: Your Complete Roadmap**

### Subheadline
We've built 50+ bitcoin-powered retreats. Here's exactly what happens—timeline, process, your role, our role—with zero surprises.

### Visual
![Construction Timeline](../assets/diagrams/construction_timeline.png)
*5-phase build process: Discovery (Weeks 1-2) → Design (3-6) → Permitting (7-18) → Construction (19-34) → Launch (35-38)*

---

## Section 1: Timeline Overview

### Visual Timeline (Horizontal)

**Phase 1: Discovery** → **Phase 2: Design** → **Phase 3: Permitting** → **Phase 4: Construction** → **Phase 5: Launch**

Week 1-2 → Week 3-6 → Week 7-18 → Week 19-34 → Week 35-38

**Average Total Timeline**: 6-8 months from first call to first booking

---

## Section 2: Phase 1 - Discovery & Assessment

### Headline
**Phase 1: Discovery & Free Assessment** (Week 1-2)

### Overview
We start with a comprehensive property evaluation to determine if your land is a good fit—and if we're a good fit for you. No cost, no pressure, just honest analysis.

---

### What Happens

**Initial Consultation (30-60 min, video call)**

We discuss:
✓ Your property (size, location, current use)
✓ Your goals (income, personal use, timeline)
✓ Your budget range
✓ Your vision and aesthetic preferences
✓ Basic feasibility (solar exposure, zoning, access)

**What we need from you**:
- Property address or GPS coordinates
- Recent photos (land, views, access roads)
- Any existing survey or site plans (if available)
- Rough budget range you're comfortable with

---

**Site Visit (If promising fit)**

We visit your property to assess:
📍 **Solar Potential**: Sun exposure, shading analysis, optimal panel placement
🏞️ **Site Selection**: Best locations for structures (views, privacy, access)
🚧 **Access & Utilities**: Road quality, distance to grid (if any), water source
📋 **Regulatory Landscape**: Zoning classification, likely permit pathway
🏗️ **Site Challenges**: Slope, drainage, soil conditions, environmental constraints

**Duration**: 2-3 hours on-site + drive time
**Who attends**: You + our engineer + optionally our permitting specialist

---

**Feasibility Report (Delivered within 1 week)**

You receive a written assessment including:
- ✅ **Go/No-Go Recommendation** (we'll tell you honestly if it's not viable)
- 📊 **Preliminary Budget Range** (rough cost estimate)
- 📅 **Estimated Timeline** (based on your jurisdiction)
- 🏗️ **Conceptual Layouts** (2-3 sketch options for placement)
- ⚡ **Energy Potential** (estimated solar production)
- 📋 **Permitting Pathway** (likely approvals needed)
- 💰 **Revenue Estimate** (conservative projection)

---

### Your Decision Point

**Option 1: Proceed to Design Phase**
If the numbers work and you're excited, we move to custom proposal development. This is where we invest significant engineering time, so we ask for a refundable design deposit ($2,000-$5,000) to ensure mutual commitment.

**Option 2: Pass**
If it's not the right time, budget doesn't align, or you're not ready—no problem. You keep the feasibility report and can revisit later. We part as friends.

**Option 3: Modify & Re-evaluate**
Sometimes the initial vision doesn't pencil out, but a modified approach does (smaller build, different structure type, phased construction). We can iterate.

---

### Cost
**$0** for initial consultation and feasibility assessment.

---

## Section 3: Phase 2 - Design & Proposal

## Section 10: FAQs About the Process

**Q: Can I speed up the timeline?**
A: Permitting is the bottleneck—we can't control county processing times. However, we can sometimes overlap design and permitting (design-build approach) to save 2-4 weeks. Construction can be expedited by adding crews (at additional cost).

**Q: What if I need to pause the project mid-stream?**
A: You can pause, but timing matters. Before permitting? Easy, minimal cost. During permitting? We can pause applications. During construction? Challenging—open sites create liability and weather exposure. We discuss exit clauses in contracts.

**Q: What happens if permits are denied?**
A: Has never happened to us (100% approval rate over 50 projects). If it did, we'd either modify the design to meet objections or refund your permitting fees. We're very good at reading jurisdictions during feasibility phase—we won't proceed if approval is unlikely.

**Q: Can I act as my own general contractor to save money?**
A: Not with us. Our fixed-price model requires us to control quality and timeline via our contractors. DIY GC often leads to cost overruns, delays, and quality issues. If you want to GC, we can provide design/engineering only (not our typical model).

**Q: How often can I visit the construction site?**
A: Anytime! We love involved owners. Just give our site manager a heads-up (safety and scheduling). We encourage weekly visits during framing and finishes—exciting to watch progress.

**Q: What if I don't like something during construction?**
A: Speak up immediately. Minor tweaks? Often easy to adjust. Major changes (different layout, added features)? Change order process (additional cost and time). We aim to get design right upfront to avoid this.
