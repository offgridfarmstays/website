**Purpose**: Primary conversion banner - establish credibility and aspiration immediately

### Image Generation Prompt:
```
Create a wide panoramic banner image (2400x800px) showing a modern luxury mini-home (400 sq ft) nestled in Montana mountain landscape at golden hour. The cabin features large floor-to-ceiling windows with warm interior lighting glowing from within, dark metal roof with integrated solar panels that blend aesthetically (not obvious), natural wood siding (cedar or similar), and a wooden deck with Adirondack chairs. In the foreground, a couple sits by a fire pit enjoying mountain views. Background shows dramatic peaks with some snow. Sky is vibrant sunset (oranges, purples). Style: Architectural photography, professional real estate, warm and inviting, aspirational but achievable. Lighting: Golden hour, soft shadows, interior lights creating ambiance.
```

**Alternative Tools**:

## Banner 3: What We Build - Mini-Homes
**Purpose**: Showcase design excellence and variety

### Image Generation Prompt:
```
Ultra-wide banner (2400x600px) showing three different mini-home architectural styles side-by-side in a triptych layout. LEFT: Modern minimalist cabin with black metal exterior, large glass windows, flat roof with solar panels, desert landscape (New Mexico). CENTER: Rustic mountain cabin with timber frame, stone chimney, gable metal roof, wood siding, mountain forest background (Montana). RIGHT: Contemporary farmhouse with white board-and-batten siding, black metal roof, large porch, rolling hills background (Vermont). All three shown at dusk with interior lights on. Style: Architectural digest quality, professional photography, warm inviting lighting. Each cabin 400-500 sq ft, clearly off-grid aesthetic.
```

**Alternative**: Individual hero images per cabin type

Outside cabin shows underground geothermal loops illustrated, sun rays hitting solar panels. Style: Technical illustration meets architectural rendering, clean lines, some transparency to show hidden systems, use color coding (orange=heat flow, blue=cool flow, yellow=electricity). Annotated with simple labels.
```

**Recommended Tool**:
- **Custom Illustration** (hire illustrator - Fiverr/Upwork): $200-500
- **Canva + Stock Graphics**: Assemble using stock cutaway home graphics + energy system icons

LINE 2 (Green, ascending): "Cumulative Revenue" starts at $0, grows steadily, crosses red line at year 2.1 (breakeven marked with star/badge), continues upward to $280K by year 7. Shaded area between lines after crossover point shows "Net Profit Zone" in light green. Include annotation callouts: "Breakeven: 2.1 years", "5-Year Return: $197K", "7-Year Return: $280K". Style: Professional financial chart, clean grid lines, legible fonts, uses color psychology (red=cost, green=revenue/profit).
```

**Data Points to Plot** (Example for $87K investment):

- **Warm**: Golden hour lighting preferred
- **Spacious**: Show landscape context, not cramped
- **Human**: Include people when possible (not empty lifeless spaces)

### Color Treatment:
- **Saturation**: Slightly boosted (10-15%) for vibrancy, not oversaturated
- **Contrast**: Medium-high (makes images pop on web)
- **Temperature**: Warm bias (+100-200K) for inviting feel
- **Consistency**: Use same LUT/preset across all project photos for cohesion

### Avoid:
- ‚ùå Heavy HDR (looks artificial)
- ‚ùå Black & white (reduces emotional impact)
- ‚ùå Extreme filters or unnatural colors
- ‚ùå Cluttered compositions
