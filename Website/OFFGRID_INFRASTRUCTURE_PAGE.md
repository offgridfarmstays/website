### Maintenance & Management

**Inspection Schedule**
- Annual inspections for ATU systems
- Tank pumping based on usage
- Monitoring for drain field saturation or failure

**Guest Education**
- No harsh chemicals or antibacterial soaps
- Limited garbage disposal use
- Water conservation practices
- What not to flush guidelines

## Hydroelectric Power Generation

### Micro-Hydro Feasibility

**Resource Assessment**
- Minimum flow requirements (typically 5+ GPM for small systems)
- Head (vertical drop) measurements
- Seasonal flow variations
- Power output calculations: P = Q × H × e (flow × head × efficiency)

**Site Requirements**
- Year-round water flow
- Sufficient elevation drop (10+ feet minimum)
- Access for installation and maintenance
- Environmental considerations

### System Components

**Intake & Penstock**
- Screened intake structure
- Penstock pipe sizing and routing
- Pressure calculations for pipe material selection
- Shut-off valves and cleanouts

**Turbine & Generator**
- Pelton wheels for high head, low flow
- Turgo or crossflow turbines for medium head
- Propeller turbines for low head, high flow
- Generator sizing and voltage selection

**Electrical Integration**
- Grid-tie inverters where utility available
- Battery bank integration with solar
- Load controllers and dump loads
- Monitoring and safety systems

### Permitting & Compliance

**Water Rights**
- State water rights permits required
- Minimum flow requirements for environmental protection
- Fish passage and screening requirements
- Annual reporting in some states

**Electrical & Safety**
- Electrical permits for installation
- Professional engineering stamps may be required
- Regular inspections and maintenance logs
- Liability insurance considerations

## Site Preparation & Coordination

### Access & Roads

**Construction Access**
- Graded roads for well drilling rigs (wide, stable)
- Equipment access for septic installation
- Material delivery routes
- All-weather surfacing considerations

**Utility Trenching**
- Water lines buried below frost depth
- Electrical conduits for solar and hydro
- Proper bedding and backfill to prevent settling
- Tracer wire for future location

### Erosion Control & Drainage

**Site Management**

### Coordination Sequencing

**Typical Timeline**
1. **Site Survey & Testing** - Perc tests, well siting, topographic surveys
2. **Well Drilling** - Complete before foundation work to ensure water availability
3. **Septic Layout** - Coordinate with building footprint and well setbacks
4. **Excavation & Utilities** - Single mobilization for trenching where possible
5. **Foundation** - After utilities are roughed in
6. **Building Construction** - Coordinate with system installations
7. **Final Connections** - Water treatment, electrical, and system commissioning

## Regional Considerations

### Climate Zones

**Cold Climates**

## Why Professional Engineering Matters

**Complex Integration**
Off-grid infrastructure requires coordinating multiple systems with unique site conditions, regulatory requirements, and operational needs.

**Regulatory Compliance**
Permits for wells, septic, water rights, and power generation vary by jurisdiction and require expert navigation.

**Long-Term Reliability**
Properly engineered systems minimize failures, reduce maintenance costs, and ensure consistent guest experiences.

**Resale Value**
Documented, permitted, professionally installed systems add significant value and marketability to the property.
