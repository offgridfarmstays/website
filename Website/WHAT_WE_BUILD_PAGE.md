## Section 12: FAQ for This Page

**Q: Can I choose a different style than your examples?**
Yes. We customize every design to your aesthetic preferences, regional character, and site constraints. Bring inspiration photos—we'll make it work.

**Q: Can you build on my existing foundation/structure?**
Sometimes. We assess existing structures for code compliance and integration feasibility. Adaptive reuse can save costs if the bones are good.

**Q: What if I want to live there full-time, not rent it?**
We can build primary residences with the same systems. The economics change (no rental income), but the energy benefits remain. Many clients do hybrid: live there 3-6 months, rent 6-9 months.

**Q: Can I add units later?**
Yes. We design energy systems with expansion in mind. Many clients build 1-2 units, validate the market, then add more. Phased growth is smart.

**Q: Do you build outside your current states?**
We're expanding. If your state isn't listed, contact us—we evaluate new markets based on demand and regulatory environment.
